# Self-Assessment-Lab | Working with RSS Feeds

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find the solutions to the ![RSS lab](https://github.com/Ironhack-Data-Madrid-Abril-2021/lab_rss). 

Your mission is to compare it with your own exercise and write a comment on your own pull-request with a brief assessment and a grade from 0 to 10 in depending on:
+ Percentage completed
+ Have I submitted all the deliverables?
+ Have I got the information I've been asked for?
+ Code quality (for example: Have I used functions intead of repeating the same code snippet again and again?)



## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
